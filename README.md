# Knowledge Archives
This is an archive on all imaginable topics, that are usefull and / or interesting to me.
I aggretate ressources here to access them easily, to benefit from a nice search engine (thanks to the mkdocs's material plugin developped by Squifunk, such a great guy), to keep them nicely organized, version controled and backuped.
This interactive knowledge static website is available [here](https://josttim.github.io/Klog/).
