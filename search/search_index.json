Next, the edges are added  one-by-one to the graph, starting from \u201cstronger\u201d to \u201cweaker\u201d edges.  This strength of the edge, or the weight of the edge, can be calculated  in different ways.</p> <p>Don\u2019t worry \u2013 we will discuss this later.

We start with the  complete graph and take off the edges iteratively. The edge with the  highest weight is removed first. At every step, the edge-weight  calculation is repeated, since the weight of the remaining edges changes after an edge is removed.

Toute les instruction de pr\u00e9processeur sont \u00e9value et font leurs jobs. Par exemples, \"#include fichier\" permet de copier le contenue de \"fichier\" \u00e0 la place de #include.</p> <p><code>&lt;...&gt;</code> for inclusions only looks in the system and library areas.  <code>\"...\"</code> also looks inside your sketch.</p> <p>Ca remplace la ligne par le contenue du fichier, carr\u00e9ment.</p> <p>Ensuite, la compilation (qui ne s'effectue QUE sur les fichiers .c). \u00c0 chaque fois que le compilateur commence \u00e0 un compiler un fichier, il  \"oublie\" tout : il ne conna\u00eet plus les fonctions, les variables, etc  etc. Il part du haut du fichier, et descend ligne par ligne en faisant ses v\u00e9rifications (syntaxique, s\u00e9mantique, etc etc). Quand il tombe sur le prototype d'une fonction, il \"retient\" cette derni\u00e8re  en m\u00e9moire (son nom, son type de retour, ses arguments ...). Quand il tombe sur un appel de fonction, il regarde dans sa m\u00e9moire s'il la conna\u00eet. Si oui, pas de soucis (a moins que mauvais nombre d'argument, retour mal  utilis\u00e9, mais \u00e7a c'est la v\u00e9rification syntaxique et s\u00e9mantique). Si non, il va \u00e9mettre un avertissement de type \"implicite declaration of function 'untel'\".</p> <p>Mais il est possible que cela n'arr\u00eate pas la compilation : le compilateur  va consid\u00e9rer que puisqu'il ne la conna\u00eet pas, c'est une fonction qui  retourne un int et qui prends aucun arguments, et si d'aventure c'est  correct s\u00e9mantiquement (par exemple, la variable qui r\u00e9cup\u00e8re le retour  de la fonction est \"compatible\" avec un int, c'est ok), alors la  compilation se poursuivra.</p> <p>Ensuite, une fois qu'il a compil\u00e9 tout les .c, le travail du vrai compilateur est termin\u00e9. C'est au tour du linker. Le linker va prendre tout les .o (c'est les .c compil\u00e9s) et les assembler. C'est a ce moment que le linker va v\u00e9rifier si chaque fonctions utilis\u00e9 dans les .c existe. Typiquement, tu as la fonction \"position\" d\u00e9fini dans \"position.c\", et utilis\u00e9 dans \"main.c\". le linker va v\u00e9rifier que la fonction \"position\" appel\u00e9 dans \"main.c\" existe bien et en un seul exemplaire.

The garbage collector attempts to reclaim memory which was allocated by the program, but is no longer referenced\u2014also called garbage There is several strategies for automatic garbage detection.</p> <p>Esoteric language or Esolang :</p> <p>An esoteric programming language (sometimes shortened to esolang) is a programming language designed to test the boundaries of computer programming language design, as a proof of concept, as software art, as a hacking interface to another language (particularly functional programming or procedural programming languages), or as a joke.  The use of esoteric distinguishes these languages from programming languages that working  developers use to write software. Usually, an esolang's creators do not  intend the language to be used for mainstream programming, although some esoteric features, such as visuospatial syntax,[1]  have inspired practical applications in the arts.  Such languages are often popular among hackers and hobbyists.</p> <p>Closures : </p> <p>In programming languages, a closure, also lexical closure or function closure, is a technique for implementing lexically scoped name binding in a language with first-class functions. Operationally, a closure is a record storing a function[a] together with an environment.[1] The environment is a mapping associating each free variable of the function (variables that are used locally, but defined in an enclosing scope) with the value or reference to which the name was bound when the closure was created.[b] Unlike a plain function, a closure allows the function to access those captured variables through the closure's copies of their values or references, even when the function is invoked outside their scope.</p> <p>Singletons :</p> <p>In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one \"single\" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.</p> <p>The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.</p> <p>Code parfait Hamming, etc.</p> <p>v=I0QRUrJDKJw</p>"},{"location":"Engineering_Knowledge/Programming/Programming_Theory/Install_Tutorials.html","title":"Installations","text":""},{"location":"Engineering_Knowledge/Programming/Programming_Theory/Install_Tutorials.html#install-anaconda","title":"Install anaconda :","text":""},{"location":"Engineering_Knowledge/Programming/Programming_Theory/Install_Tutorials.html#import-yml-environment","title":"Import yml environment :","text":""},{"location":"Engineering_Knowledge/Programming/Programming_Theory/Install_Tutorials.html#install-python-connector-and-workbench-for-your-os","title":"Install python connector, and workbench for your os :","text":""},{"location":"Engineering_Knowledge/Programming/Programming_Theory/Install_Tutorials.html#if-issues-with-python-connector","title":"if issues with python connector :","text":"<p>Format the connect_string this way :</p> <pre><code>connect string = 'mysql+mysqlconnector://user:password@mysql_server/database?use_pure=True'\n</code></pre> <p>\u200b       ?use_pure=True allow you to bypass the C implemented libraries to acess the mysql server.</p>"},{"location":"Engineering_Knowledge/Programming/Programming_Theory/Install_Tutorials.html#jupyter-lab-extensions","title":"Jupyter lab extensions :","text":"<p>\u200b   To run jupyter lab integrated widgets :</p> <pre><code>pip install ipywidgets\n</code></pre> <p>\u200b   install and activate in conda env with :</p> <pre><code>jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager\njupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Engineering_Knowledge/Programming/Programming_Theory/Install_Tutorials.html#install-mkdocs","title":"Install MKdocs :","text":"<p>To run automatically a batch file at startup :</p> <p>Open Run ( search run ou executer )</p> <p>type shell:startup or \"C:\\Users\\Timothe\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\" in the explorer</p>"},{"location":"Engineering_Knowledge/Programming/Programming_Theory/Install_Tutorials.html#trouble-shoot","title":"Trouble Shoot :","text":"<p>If conda cause issues with \"openssl_sk_new_reserve could not be located\" and cannot install new packages :  </p> <p>copy libssl-1_1-x64 dlls from </p> <pre><code>C:/Users/user/Anaconda3/DLLS\n</code></pre> <pre><code>to\n</code></pre> <pre><code>C:/Users/user/Anaconda3/Library/bin\n</code></pre> <p>(overwrite, probably dates are different and are causing the issue)</p> <p>use call before a command, if not, the command will be executed and the shell closed once done, even if there is still code in the file.
