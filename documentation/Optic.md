> An **acousto-optic deflector** (AOD) spatially controls the optical  beam.  In the operation of an acousto-optic deflector the power driving  the acoustic transducer is kept on, at a constant level, while the  acoustic frequency is varied to deflect the beam to different angular  positions.

<u>[Multimode fiber optics](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=10417) : [ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-mode_optical_fiber)</u>

- Based on light [mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(electromagnetism)) wich is the orientation of oscilation of magnetic and eletric (H and E) fields regarding the direction of travel of the wave. It's analoguous to mechanical systems normal [modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mode).

- Transmision is limited in length by [modal dispersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_dispersion) (about 940 meters)

It simply is a [wave guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveguide) where the index of the optical core and coating make light undergo total internal reflection, if entering below an acceptance angle (wich value derivates to the number of **aperture** of the fiber)

[Single Mode fibers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-mode_optical_fiber#Quadruply_clad_fiber)

> In [fiber-optic communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber-optic_communication), a **single-mode optical fiber** (**SMF**), also known as fundamental- or mono-mode,[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-mode_optical_fiber#cite_note-1) is an [optical fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber) designed to carry only a single [mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(electromagnetism)) of light - the [transverse mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_mode).

Fundamental modes :

> The lowest order mode of a waveguide.
>
> *Ttransverse modes* (or *lateral modes*). are fundamental modes.
>
> The fundamental mode of a waveguide is the one with the highest [effective refractive index](https://www.rp-photonics.com/effective_refractive_index.html).

[Higher order mode :](https://www.rp-photonics.com/higher_order_modes.html) 

> Basically, all modes other than the fundamental are higher order modes.
>
> Not all waveguides support higher-order modes, at least not within their guided modes; they are then called *single-mode waveguides*
>
> Higher-order modes are more susceptible to attenuation in wave guides. They are also more sensitive to bending loss.
>
> Better for light throughput at lower distances (like LED or lamp launch condition, overfilled.)

[Lower order mode :](https://www.yourdictionary.com/low-order-mode)

> A physical path taken by a signal or signal component that is either  parallel to or relatively modestly transverse to the waveguide. Some signal components travel directly through the center of the waveguide,  at least theoretically, and, therefore, travel the shortest possible  distance between the point at which they enter the waveguide and the  point at which they exit the waveguide. They are the one that occur more with an underfilled launch condition (laser input) better for light throughput at long distances (>10/20m). Less sensitive to bending loss and attenuation.
