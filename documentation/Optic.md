## Active components :

### AOM/AOD :

[AOM (acousto optic modulators)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acousto-optic_modulator#Modelocking) : 

[![img](Optic.assets/260px-Acousto-optic_Modulator.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Acousto-optic_Modulator.png)

> An **acousto-optic modulator (AOM)**, also called a **Bragg cell** or an **acousto-optic deflector (AOD)**, uses the [acousto-optic effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acousto-optic_effect) to [diffract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction) and shift the frequency of light using [sound waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_wave) (usually at [radio-frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency)).

[AOD (acousto optic deflectors)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acousto-optic_deflector) : 

[![img](Optic.assets/539px-Bragg's_Condition.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bragg's_Condition.jpg)

> An **acousto-optic deflector** (AOD) spatially controls the optical  beam.  In the operation of an acousto-optic deflector the power driving  the acoustic transducer is kept on, at a constant level, while the  acoustic frequency is varied to deflect the beam to different angular  positions.

### Optic Fibers

[Fused imaging fiber optics](https://www.schott.com/en-us/products/fused-imaging-fiber-optics) :

> SCHOTT Fused Imaging Fiber Optics can be designed to magnify, minify,  invert or simply transfer an original image to anywhere needed for  defense, medical, and industrial applications.

- [Sonnar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeiss_Sonnar)

<u>Catadioptric / reflective lenses :</u>

[Catadroptric system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catadioptric_system) was often used in the 70-80s for [telephoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephoto) [lenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_lens). [Advantages and invonvenients :](https://advancedphototech.wordpress.com/lenses/mirror-mirror-a-guide-to-choosing-and-using-mirror-lenses/)

> Advantages : Lightweight , less expensive, no chromatic aberration
>
> Disadvantages : donut bokeh (can be an advantage as it is quite artistic), fixed aperture and focal length, vignetting, low contrast

### Prisms:

![prismsfigure3](Optic.assets/prismsfigure3.jpg)

- [Wedge Prisms](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=147) : a set of 2 can allow for 2D displacement of a light ray(can be both used for projecting or reading with an adjustable FOV camera) if both are rotatively controlled.
- [Dove prisms](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=6810) are able to retroreflect (and invert) image or rotate the image by twice the angle applied to the prism relative to the image source orientation.

- Risley Prism Beam ([RPUPS - universal pointing system](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/9579/95790B/Risley-prism-universal-pointing-system-RPUPS/10.1117/12.2188088.short?SSO=1)) ( based on wedge prisms )
