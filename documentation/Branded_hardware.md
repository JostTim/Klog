> **Pedal Sensor Check**
>
> Another reason to why your motor wheel is not receiving power from the battery is due to the pedal sensor connection.
>
> Please check that the pedal sensor is flashing when the pedals are rotating.
>
> If not please disconnect your pedal sensor from the Handle Bar Bracket and check for any pins out of place in the outlet.
>
> Once reconnected, if the pedal sensor still does not flash and power is not provided to the motor wheel, please contact [support@swytchbike.com](mailto:support@swytchbike.com) so our technical team can resolve this issue with further questioning.

>  
>
> **Power Pack Check**
>
> For this check please make sure that the Power Pack is taken off the  bike and turned off. Make sure also that rocker switch at the back of  the Power Pack is turned off.

<u>Battery type :</u> 

*NJMFY **10S2P*** -> 36V (10*3.6V and 2 in parallel for sucking more Amps ([18650 standard batteries](https://commonsensehome.com/18650-battery/)) and about 5-10 Ah)

![image-20220504113557887](Branded_hardware.assets/image-20220504113557887.png)

Plug seems to be T type from what i've seen.

*Communication Interface ???* for the battery ? 12C / DQ / SMBus ?

*BMS???*

**CRD** : max amps drawn constant - About 20Amps 

> Fortunately there's a direct relation between CDR (A) and battery  capacity (mAh). The higher the capacity, the lower the CDR. That means  devices that draw less power can take advantage of higher-capacity  cells. Hungrier devices will need to use lower-capacity cells in order  to safely draw more current.
>
> At the time of writing (June 2018), the current maximum CDR  attainable in an 18650 battery is 38A at 2000mAh. Some bogus  manufacturers claim ratings of 40A, or 35A at 3000mAh or greater, but  these are not trustworthy ratings. Battery technology evolves  constantly, so expect this to change.
