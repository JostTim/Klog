[Mainframe computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer)

> A mainframe computer is large but not as large as supercomputer and has  more processing power than some other classes of computers, such as [minicomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicomputer), [servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)), [workstations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workstation), and [personal computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer). Most large-scale computer-system architectures were established in the  1960s, but they continue to evolve. Mainframe computers are often used  as servers. It is still a denomination in use.
